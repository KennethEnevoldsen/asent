==============

The following fold out menus contain all of the languages included in Asent.
The :octicon:`beaker;1em;sd-text-info` indicate that the language lexicon is
autogenerated and therefore experimental.

      .. tab-item:: Default

         :bdg-info-line:`License: MIT`

         The lexicons contain a list of rated words for English along with intensifiers,
         contrastive conjugations and negations. The words are rated by 
         `Hutto and Gilbert, (2014) <https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/14550>`__.

         The lexicons contain a total of 7504 rated words, 59 negations, 84 intensifiers,
         and 1 contrastive conjugations.

         You can load the English lexicons using:

         .. code-block:: python

            from asent import lexicons
            rated_words = lexicons.get("lexicon_en_v1")

         This sentiment lexicon were generated by `Chen, Y., & Skiena, S. (2014) <https://aclanthology.org/P14-2063.pdf>`__
         using by propagation using a knowledge graph - a graphical representation of
         real-world entities and the
         links between them. The general intuition is that words which are closely
         linked on a knowledge graph probably have similar sentiment polarities. For
         this project, sentiments were generated based on English sentiment lexicons.
