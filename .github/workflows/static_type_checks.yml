            If you want to fix this, we recommend doing it locally by either:
            
              a) Enabling pyright in VSCode and going through the errors in the problems tab 
            
            `VSCode settings > Python > Analysis: Type checking mode > "basic"`
            
              b) Debugging via the command line
            
                1. Installing pyright, which is included in the dev dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
                2. Diagnosing the errors by running `pyright .`

      - uses: mshick/add-pr-comment@v2
        if: ${{ steps.pyright.outputs.pyright_failed == 0 && steps.find_comment.outputs.comment-id != '' && github.event_name == 'pull_request'}}
        with:
          message-id: ${{ steps.find_comment.outputs.comment-id }}
          message: |
            ðŸŒŸ pyright succeeds! ðŸŒŸ

      - name: Show pyright output
        id: fail_run
        if: ${{steps.pyright.outputs.pyright_failed == 1}}
        run: |
          inv static-type-checks # Rerunning pyright isn't optimal computationally, but typically takes no more than a couple of seconds, and this ensures that the errors are in the failing step
