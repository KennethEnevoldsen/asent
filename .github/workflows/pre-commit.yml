            Looks like some formatting rules failed.

            ‚ú® The action has attempted automatic fixes ‚ú®

            If any were succesful, they were committed to the branch.
            We suggest using `git pull --rebase` to apply them locally. 

            If some errors could not be fixed automatically, you can:

            üèéÔ∏è Get results locally by running `pre-commit run --all-files`
            üïµÔ∏è Examine the results in the `Run pre-commit` section of this workflow `pre-commit` 

            We also recommend setting up the `ruff` and `black` extensions to auto-format on save in your chosen editor.
